        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p class="OurProblem">A hopeful environmentalist needs to have access to reliable and consistent information regarding eco-friendly best practices because they have trouble implementing correct habits around reducing, reusing, and recycling. Many users found it diffuclt to access reliable information regarding eco-friendly habits and often were unsure of where to even begin.</p>

    <section class="Solution">
        <h2 class="solution">Solution</h2>
        <p class="OurSolution">The project was done by my small cohort at The University of Texas at Austin.

            After talking with people who consider themselves to be non-recyclers or frequent recyclers, we noticed the difficulty to find accurate information regarding recycling, composting and related information.  We conducted some initial research via competitor analysis and found a number of products that offered similar solutions, however none combined the informative factor along with gamification and the social components we created in our application. From there the goal was to create a product that was informative and helpful to the user, by providing them with relevant information, while also adding in a gamification aspect that encouraged the user to return to the app and continue making eco-friendly choices. </p>

                    interviewee 17 open ended questions regarding their eco-friendly habits as well as their general knowledge when 
                    it comes to environmental best practices and the impact these practices have on the world. From there we sent 
                    out a survey with a variety of types of questions surrounding the same subjects of questions asked in our interviews. 
                    We received 43 responses and found that nearly 50% of people do not feel like they are doing enough when it comes 
                    to reducing, reusing, and recycling, however 75% of people do wish they were doing more.

Most applications we looked at offered information on the how to, while some offered a gamification option that
turned recycling into a competition. However, we did not find an app that would offer exactly what we are looking to 
do- creating a platform that incorporates the informational aspect, as well as the gamification piece into one product.

                            After reviewing our survey and interview data, we realized that we likely have two users: expert and non-expert. 
                            Each person will have a different level of understanding when it comes to environmental best practices, therefore we 
                            created two user personas to reflect people with more or less knowledge on the subject. We discussed each user in 
                            great detail, understanding the expert and non-expert’s goals and limitations well. 
                            
                            Our expert, Kristine, already has a plethora of knowledge regarding eco-friendly habits. Her goal is to create a better 
                            planet for her children to live in. She is currently doing her best to recycle, reduce and reuses where she can and feels 
                            as though she has a good understanding of the protocols for each. However, she wants to do more and would like a 
                            product that allows her to access information so she can learn more as well as help educate others on the environment. 
                            
                            Our second user, James, is less environmentally friendly. Although he understands why we should reduce, reuse, or recycle, 
                            he doesn’t see the impact and does not feel it matters very much. James would like to be more informed and create 
                            eco-friendly habits, however he needs a tool that is easy to understand and use so he can begin his environmental journey.

                            When creating our user flow we wanted to make sure the process was easy to follow and eliminate extraneous 
                            steps that may be unnecessary. We also wanted to combine the plight of both users, Kristine and James, so the app 
                            is easy for everyone to navigate and contains relevant information. Based on the users needs, we wanted to include 
                            steps that allow the user to quickly search or scan items to understand how they should dispose of the item. From 
                            there, we wanted to include a gaming aspect as a way to encourage repeat use of the app and empower users to 
                            invite friends to download the app as well. We added in a gaming and points feature that allows the user to gain 
                            points each time they perform an eco-friendly task. We also incorporated a leaderboard function to allow users to 
                            see where they stand against their friends as a way to encourage them to increase their habits and use the app more.
                            Another top priority feature was the feed on the homepage. This feature was created to allow users to see their 
                            recent activity, including articles they may have read or other information they have recently looked at. The user can 
                            quickly reference articles and information via the app if they would like to learn more about a particular subject.

                            When creating our wireframes we split into two groups to create two different sets of frames. Group A created 
                            wireframes focused on the gaming aspect, while Group B created wireframes focusing on the feed aspect.  We 
                            used the same onboarding screens and otherwise kept the flow identical. After conducting 5 user tests on each 
                            prototype we discussed any pain points and positives within each group. We found that users enjoyed the gaming 
                            aspect and were slightly confused by the feed and the way it was displayed. However, users greatly appreciated
                            having the ability to text search an item or scan or take a photo of an item to them learn more about how to 
                            dispose of it properly. Group As users also enjoyed the gaming piece and found it fun to compete with their friends 
                            via the app. However, we did find that many users were slightly confused by the language used in each version of the 
                            app and the icons were difficult to understand as well.

                        After completing this project we have learned how critical user testing and iteration is to a product. Understanding 
                        the user’s needs is incredibly important, and as we learned, there are many different types of users with very specific 
                        wants and needs. It was very interesting to talk to users and understand their varying levels of understanding when it 
                        comes to reducing, reusing and recycling. After gathering our data we understood that our product would need to fit 
                        each person’s knowledge level and must be inclusive of every user. We then created our two prototypes to A/B test 
                        them on different users, not knowing which platform would be understood or liked more. However, we saw that users 
                        appreciated having an easy to use app that provided them with useful information when they needed it. We then iterated 
                        on our designs to create our final prototype. One of our biggest difficulties was trying to fit all of our ideas into one 
                        product without overwhelming the user. We are very proud of our final prototype, although we would love to iterate 
                        on it more and create a useful tool for every user, regardless of their environmental savviness.
